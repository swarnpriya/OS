# What is OS?
The software system that manages hardware resources for both users and their applications.
## Roles of OS:
- Act as a refree: It helps in managing the shared resources between the different applications/users. Example: CPU act as a shared 
  resource. We have only one CPU who is going to use it. In this case we need to decide which process will access the CPU at 
  any moment and any process should not be in the starvation condition (means every process should get the chance to access the CPU).
  
- Provide abstraction (Illusionist): It helps in hiding the complex details of the hardware from the users.
- Act as a glue: Provide common services to facilitate sharing between different applications.
